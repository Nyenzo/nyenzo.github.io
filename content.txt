About My Background
I'm a Nairobi-born creative who embraces life's unpredictable flow. Growing up in Kenya's vibrant capital shaped my adventurous spirit and love for discovering new experiences.
My Interests & Hobbies
Music flows through my daily life—I play both piano and guitar, finding rhythm in melodies. When I'm not making music, you'll find me swimming laps, gaming, or diving into a good book.
My Philosophy
I believe in the beauty of deep conversations and surrendering to life's natural rhythm. There's something freeing about accepting that we can't control everything, so why not enjoy the journey?
Staying Active & Creative
Fitness keeps my body strong while writing feeds my soul. I love balancing physical activity with creative expression, whether that's crafting stories or exploring new workout routines.
My Curious Nature
I'm endlessly fascinated by learning new things and pushing my boundaries. Adventure calls to me, whether it's trying a new skill, exploring unfamiliar places, or simply having meaningful conversations with interesting people.
Fun Facts I Love Sharing
Here's something wild: bananas are technically berries, but strawberries aren't! And did you know the Eiffel Tower grows over 6 inches taller in summer due to thermal expansion?
Tech & AI Fascination
I'm captivated by AI's rapid evolution. Facebook once had to shut down chatbots that invented their own language, and now AI can reconstruct images from human brainwaves. The future is both exciting and mind-bending.
My Approach to Life
I embrace spontaneity and meaningful connections. Life's too short for surface-level interactions—I'd rather dive deep into conversations that matter and experiences that challenge me to grow.
